 * DATA FLOW & INTEGRATION
 * ==============================================================================
 * 
 * TICKET LIFECYCLE:
 * 1. CREATION: Customer Portal or Chatbot → TicketService.createTicket()
 * 2. ASSIGNMENT: Admin/System → Employee Dashboard
 * 3. PROCESSING: Employee → Status Updates → Work Notes
 * 4. RESOLUTION: Employee → Mark Resolved → Customer Notification
 * 5. CLOSURE: Customer Confirmation → Final Closure → Analytics
 * 
 * CHATBOT INTEGRATION:
 * 1. Customer initiates chat → ChatBot component loads
 * 2. AI processes request → Determines if ticket needed
 * 3. ChatBotTicketModal opens → Pre-populated with context
 * 4. Customer reviews/submits → TicketService creates ticket
 * 5. Ticket appears in employee queue → Normal workflow begins
 * 
 * API INTEGRATION:
 * - Primary: Attempts backend API calls
 * - Fallback: Uses localStorage with sample data
 * - Error Handling: Graceful degradation to demo mode
 * - Offline Support: Limited functionality with cached data
