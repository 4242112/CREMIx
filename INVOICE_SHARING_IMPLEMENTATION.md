# Invoice Sharing Implementation Summary

## What has been implemented:

### Backend Changes:

1. **InvoiceController.java** - Added new endpoint:
   - `POST /api/invoices/{id}/send` - Allows employees to send invoices to customers via email

2. **InvoiceService.java** - Added new interface method:
   - `sendInvoiceToCustomer(Long invoiceId)` - Service method to send invoice to customer

3. **InvoiceServiceImpl.java** - Implemented the invoice sending functionality:
   - Retrieves invoice details by ID
   - Gets customer email and name
   - Sends email notification using EmailService
   - Proper error handling and logging

4. **QuotationService.java** - Enhanced quotation acceptance:
   - Added automatic invoice generation when quotation is accepted
   - Added automatic invoice sending to customer after generation
   - Made the process transactional to ensure data integrity
   - Added proper error handling (quotation acceptance won't fail if invoice generation/sending fails)

### Frontend Changes:

1. **InvoiceService.js** - Added new method:
   - `sendInvoiceToCustomer(invoiceId)` - Frontend service to call the invoice sending API

2. **InvoicesTab.jsx** - Created new admin component:
   - Complete invoice management interface for employees/admins
   - View all invoices with customer details, amounts, dates, and status
   - Send invoices to customers with one-click functionality
   - Real-time feedback with loading states and notifications
   - Invoice detail modal for viewing complete information
   - Professional UI with proper error handling

### Workflow:

1. **Automatic Process:**
   - When customer accepts a quotation → Invoice is automatically generated → Invoice is automatically sent to customer

2. **Manual Process:**
   - Employees can view all invoices in the admin dashboard
   - Employees can manually send any invoice to the customer again
   - Real-time feedback shows sending status

### Email Integration:

- Uses existing EmailService infrastructure
- Sends professional email notifications to customers with invoice details
- Includes invoice number, amount, due date, and customer portal login instructions

## Files Modified/Created:

- `InvoiceServiceImpl.java` - Implemented sending logic
- `QuotationService.java` - Enhanced with auto-invoice functionality

### Frontend:
- `InvoiceService.js` - Added sending method

## API Endpoint Added:
```

```

This implementation provides a complete solution for the requirement "If customer accept quotation then employee should be able to share invoice to the customer" with both automatic and manual sharing capabilities.
