# Quotation Edit Restriction Implementation

## What has been implemented:

### Backend Changes:

1. **QuotationService.java** - Added validation to prevent editing accepted quotations:
   - Added status check in `updateQuotation()` method
   - Throws `IllegalStateException` for ACCEPTED or CONVERTED quotations
   - Error message: "Cannot modify quotation that has been accepted or converted. Current stage: {stage}"

2. **QuotationController.java** - Enhanced error handling:
   - Added try-catch block to handle `IllegalStateException`
   - Returns HTTP 400 (Bad Request) with error message for validation failures
   - Returns HTTP 404 (Not Found) for quotations that don't exist

### Frontend Changes:

1. **QuotationPage.jsx** - Added UI restrictions:
   - Added `isEditingAllowed()` function to check quotation status
   - Disabled "Edit Quotation" button for ACCEPTED and CONVERTED quotations
   - Added tooltip explaining why editing is disabled
   - Enhanced error handling to show specific messages for edit restrictions
   - Prevented form from showing for non-editable quotations

## Business Logic:

### Quotation Stages and Edit Permissions:
- ✅ **DRAFT** - Can be edited
- ✅ **SENT** - Can be edited (but will change back to DRAFT when edited)
- ❌ **ACCEPTED** - Cannot be edited (locked)
- ❌ **CONVERTED** - Cannot be edited (locked - invoice has been generated)
- ✅ **REJECTED** - Can be edited (can be modified and resent)

### Workflow Protection:
1. **When quotation is accepted:**
   - Invoice is automatically generated
   - Quotation stage changes to ACCEPTED
   - All editing is permanently disabled

2. **When invoice is generated:**
   - Quotation stage changes to CONVERTED
   - Quotation becomes permanently locked

### User Experience:
- **Visual feedback:** Edit button is disabled and grayed out
- **Informative tooltips:** Users see why they can't edit
- **Clear error messages:** API responses explain the restriction
- **Consistent behavior:** Both frontend and backend enforce the same rules

## API Response Examples:

### Successful Update (DRAFT/SENT/REJECTED):
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "Updated Quotation",
  "stage": "DRAFT",
  ...
}
```

### Failed Update (ACCEPTED/CONVERTED):
```
HTTP 400 Bad Request
"Cannot modify quotation that has been accepted or converted. Current stage: ACCEPTED"
```

## Files Modified:

### Backend:
- `QuotationService.java` - Added validation logic
- `QuotationController.java` - Enhanced error handling

### Frontend:
- `QuotationPage.jsx` - Added UI restrictions and better error handling

## Benefits:

1. **Data Integrity:** Prevents accidental modification of finalized quotations
2. **Business Process Protection:** Ensures accepted quotations remain unchanged
3. **Invoice Consistency:** Prevents discrepancies between quotations and generated invoices
4. **Audit Trail:** Maintains accurate record of what was actually accepted by customers
5. **Professional Workflow:** Enforces proper business practices

This implementation ensures that once a customer accepts a quotation, it becomes immutable, protecting the integrity of the sales process and maintaining consistency with any generated invoices.
